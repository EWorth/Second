	Skills I suppose are hard to define. Pace offeres a variety but the breadth and depth is not there, everything else needs to be done on personal time, most of that is fine, if I didn't also need to work. So my skills are very basic and I feel like Pace isn't offereing the best service in the way of "Must Know" when it comes to what will be used in the real world. Anyway here are a list of skills I have aquired and somewhat have forgotten because of lack of use (I actually copied most of these pages from my digital media class) since I've be Pace:
<br>
 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Java script</li>
<li>HTML and CSS</li>
<li>FTK and Blacklight</li>
</ul>
