<h1>Introduction</h1>

About me:
	I am a senior studying IT with a focus in cyber security. I enjoy learning most things technical and like to solve puzzles and challenges. The hardest part about technical jobs and skills is that they can be tedious and repetitive. I've been interested in computers and technology since I was a teenager and built my first computer in 2004, it ran well until last year when one of that plastic anchors holding the heatsink broke and was unable to be repaired.

<br>
	I would like to continue with a career in cyber security after I graduate.
